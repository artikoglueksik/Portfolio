Abstain in the 2024 presidential elections

Located on a geography of Archipelagos, Indonesia is a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural country with a population of 273 million people and a large territory. Indonesian society is characterized by ethnic variety and cultivation of Islamization, Indianization and Dutch colonialism. In 1945 Indonesian state proclaimed its independence from Netherlands after a collective struggle that united its constituent societies. Once the common battle against Dutch imperialism had been won, the passionate differences dividing various nationalist about the future of Indonesia surfaced.[i]

In 1950s federalist movements emerged leading central government to take harsh measures for suppression. Government of Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia, thus became against the idea of a federation of loosely knit regions. The source of this inner confrontation was the deep disagreements about the nature of the state itself, particularly the issues of federalism and the role of Islam[ii]. On the other hand, the first but provisional 1945 constitution had proved to be embracing and elastic frame for political life. In the preamble was the Pancasila, meaning five principles, that states:

belief in the One and Only God,

just and civilized humanity,

the unity of Indonesia,

and democratic life led by wisdom of thoughts in deliberation amongst representatives of the people,

and achieving social justice for all the people of Indonesia.[iii]

Yet the readoption of 1945 constitution couldn’t be achieved due to fragmentated composition of the Constituent Assembly. The body deadlocked on two fundamental issues, the role of Islam in the state and the question of federalism.[iv] As a consequence Sukarno was left with the choice of assuming extra-constitutional authority and from thereon a military rule standing behind him prevailed in 1959. The military rule remained at power until 1998 in which Suharto, the president after Sukarno, resigned with the pressure of students and scholars. After his resignment two constitutional reforms had been made in 1998 and 2007 starting a transition to Democracy. This democratic transition has entirely dismantled the institutionalized politicization of the Pancasila.

After the 1999 and 2004 elections, 2009 elections’ political scene once again witnessed the fragmentation of political life. Except, and contrary to 1950s, there were no radical parties but a cluster in the middle of the political spectrum. Besides to constitute a significant block of votes, an inclusionary coalition must be formed. Therefor every party is a potential partner to each other and bargaining is key to political success. The two parties that are farthest apart on the political spectrum —the strongly secular PDI-P and the fervently Islamist Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) —have even formed local coalitions when it suited their needs.[v] In this political pattern, however, parties compete for political spoils rather than creating programmatic solutions to contemporary problems.

On 14 February 2024 general elections were held in Indonesia to elect the president, vice president, People’s consultative assembly and members of local legislative bodies with 205 million registered voters. Incumbent president Joko Widodo were prohibited to participate in elections for he was ineligible to run for a third term due to the restrictions established by the constitution. Three pairs of president and wise president have competed in the presidential elections and for the legislative elections 17 parties were qualified to participate. The presidential candidate of Advanced Indonesia Coalition Prabowo Subianto won the elections by 58.70 percent of votes cast. Prabowo’s campaign was mostly focused on restoring his image associated with his military career. He affectively used social media, particularly tiktok app, considering four fifth of the population have access to internet.

Prabowo’s wise presidential candidate Gibran Rakabuming caused controversy as his age was lower than the required minimum age of 40. However, in 2023 Constitutional Courte of Indonesia had made an amendment 40-year minimum age criteria, allowing those younger than 40 who had been previously elected as regional leaders to run as presidential or vice-presidential candidates[vi]. This allowed 36 years old and son of the incumbent president Joko Widodo to run for the wise presidency. Controversy arose from the fact that court chief justice, Anwar Usman, is Gibran’s uncle. Usman was then deprived of his position by Honorary Council of the Constitutional Court on 8 November after finding him guilty of conflict of interest on the ruling[vii]. A lawsuit was filed by the Indonesian Democracy Defenders (TPDI) and the Indonesian Advocates Movement (Perekat Nusantara) against Joko Widodo, Gibran Rakabuming, Anwar Usman and First Lady Iriana alleging nepotism and political dynasty on the part of the respondents, but was dismissed by the Jakarta State Administrative Court a day before the election.[viii]
